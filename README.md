## ðŸ’š Special Thanks
I extend my heartfelt gratitude to ***Insat Android Club*** for the opportunity they gave me to create this educational project and present it in front of young aspiring game development pupils. I enjoyed every second showing the youngsters the basics of creating a simple game and the smiles and appreciation I got from them was the best reward.
